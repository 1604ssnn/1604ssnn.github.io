    <p>A good way to incorporate ideas into the public with minimal questions asked is to introduce fear. But fear of what you ask, well this could be anything from being threatened to lose your job to reading an article about terrism on facebook. There are numerous ways our governments around the world use the idea of "Fear Culture" to incorporate new laws and get away with the hidden agendas these laws bring. In this article we are going to look at many different examples at how "Five Eyes" literally considered the world most robust and biggest surveillance agency in the world consisting of Us, Uk, New Zealand, Australia and canada, Was able to use "fear culture" to ultimately get the public on side with their mass surveillance program as well as continue to dance on the thin line between what is legal and what is not.</p>

    <p>In secret five eyes was formed after the second world war in 1946 however it was never revealed to the public until decades later with it first emerging after 9/11. Not being known at the time 9/11 was unfortunately the spark that lit the fire on what is called the revelations of global mass surveillance. It was a horrific incident that still affects many people to this very day but at what cost. After the unforgivable incident happened it left the public afraid, afraid of their own lives as well as their families however there was nothing in place that could stop this same event from happening again. American government didn't want the public to turn around and start to put the blame on them for the lack of preparation so with this thinking in mind they left the problem in the hands of a man named Dick Chaney who at the time was considered one of the most unpopular american politicians while he served as the vice president under George W. bush. When listening to a podcast involving Edward Snowden a man who worked for the NSA and CIA throughout his career he said that "Dick Chaney was a man who had a good idea on what we were allowed and not allowed to do and with that knowledge he took that little dial on what the government wasn't allowed to do and he changed it all the way until it broke and snapped off until there was nothing that they couldn't do anymore. Long story short everything they could monitor they would." If you haven't already picked up on it, it's extremely obvious that American government has been and still continues to violate the supreme law of the United States to this day however one could say "isn't that what they're supposed to do." And although it may seem logical those who agree with the statement are wrong.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later into this Edwards podcast he explained that "Under the framework of the constitution the government is only supposed to be monitoring the people that have individualized particularised suspicion of wrongdoing". With this government surveillance program underway it originally began to monitor terrorist movements by monitoring phone calls and internet communications such as emails of everyone they could get access to. After time the U.S government realised that this method was actually inadequate at retrieving the information they wanted because of the fact that the majority of terrorists they were monitoring had a very outdated way of communicating with each other whether that be by sending handwritten letters to chinese whispers. After coming to the realisation that this method wasn't helping them retrieve the information they hoped one could interpret the idea that this surveillance program would be stopped however the opposite occurred. As said further along in the podcast by Edward. "Because this went on for so long, they began getting comfortable with it and thought , what if we were to start using stuff for things other than terrorism." And that's exactly what happened. Over time again as seen through previous examples "fear culture" was used to slowly step by step change the constitutional rights without the public even being aware of what exactly was going on.</p>

    <p>In this podcast Edward then goes into further detail about these changes being made saying "Over 500 members of congress were prohibited from knowing and even the ones who did know were getting their pockets stuffed with money to be quiet." Without any notice of the circumstances over time the public slowly began to move away from being partners to the government but ultimately subject to them. Edward then follows up his previous statement by saying "We the public are slowly having less to say in a lot of the policies being introduced by the government". Now one could assume that these unlawful actions must be going against whichever president holds the power at the time but unfortunately this just wasn't the case. Due to the power the president holds it meant that they were the ones who had their had on the lever meaning they got to use it if they thought the circumstances were necessary.</p>

    <p>While listening to this podcast it became unusual to me as to why someone wouldn't just inform the institution of the problem the public faces and take action from there however as Edward said "You can't go through the institution because the institution knows its wrong doing and is doing it anyway". Well what about the people that work for the CIA and NSA surely someone would have enough and want to make a change. With this statement in mind Edward then talks about "Human intelligence" which long story short is where the CIA try to turn people or massive corporations like a telecommunications company by offering them massive amounts of money in return for doing something like selling out their country. Edward then talks about the fact that there is a clear overclassification problem within these corporations which in long is how they are able to keep all this hidden from the public with Edward saying "When the average person works at the NSA or CIA they're not supposed to know what the persons doing in the office next to you because you don't have "need to know" and the reason they have this is so there isn't one person who has a grasp of everything going on ultimately realizing all the bad that's happening.</p>

    <p>Government surveillance is getting worse for us as the public as time goes on and from an average person's standpoint the only way any of these issues may be resolved is by us the public beginning to go against the grain of everyone else and making a stand, because as individuals we are weak but together we can make a massive impact.</p>
