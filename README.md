## PROJECT FOCUS:
### Title: The Digital Dilemma: An international espionage campaign against humanity

To elaborate, this topic is specifically focussed on government surveillance of people all over the world through both proprietary digital products, and tax-payer funded surveillance programs.

We chose this topic because it is a digital system in the field of computer science we are all particularly interested in: how the digital world makes humans easier than ever to control and manipulate.

The reason why this particular topic is so important, is because we are so engrossed by the digital products we use, that we have ignored previous warnings about protecting our digital footprint, and become naive about the reality of a surveillance state.

The entire focus of our novel investigation is to expose how international government surveillance programs such as PRISM and the Five-Eyes coalition are abusing peopleâ€™s rights to privacy, and reveal how those programs collect massive quantities of data for the governments.

> Opportunities: Regardless of the countless negative consequences of international government surveillance, these massive programs give governments a deep understanding of human behaviour, which is a great opportunity for them to be able to pre-empt terrorist activity, trafficking, or organised crime.

> Risks: This ignites the risk of surveilling innocent people that have done nothing wrong to warrant the government snooping on their private lives. Another risk of this surveillance is that when people find out their lives are being scrutinised, they could start working to undermine their own government, which comes with its own set of consequences.

> Choices: People these days choose to use proprietary technology, and simply accept the terms and conditions without actually understanding what they mean. The reason why we choose to do this, is due to convenience, and from our perspective, we see that convenience is one of the main reasons we allow ourselves to be surveilled, rather than keeping anonymous and having a difficult time browsing the internet.
