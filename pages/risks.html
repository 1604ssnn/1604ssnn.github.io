  <h2 style="text-align: center;">The negative aspects of Government Surveillance</h2>

  <p>81% of the US population believe the risks of data collection far outweigh the positive aspects. (Pew Research, 2019). While there are many advantages of government surveillance that benefit our society, such as being able to track terrorists, or prevent widespread infection of a virus, we would be remiss if we failed to mention all the risks of government surveillance, that to an extent, far outweigh the benefits. As put by M. Richards (2013), there are two major risks of government surveillance that directly impact every person in society: the first is that when people know they are being watched, they tend to hold back themselves from exploring new political or social ideologies, and therefore tend to adhere to conventional ideas, rather than thinking for themselves due to the threat of being questioned for being 'different'.</p>

  <p>M. Richards (2013) further tells us the second biggest risk that can arise from this, is that those surveilling could start using the data they collect to discriminate against people with ideas they do not agree with, which would drive a wedge through our society, causing people to develop a tribalistic sense of community, where society is divided based on ideology, rather than coming together as one people.</p>
  
  <p>We know that governments are collecting unauthorised data from people, because from classified information leaked in 2013, we see that private corporations such as Microsoft (Snowden, 2013) joined forces with the NSA in the United States, giving them backdoor access to their own products, such as Microsoft Outlook.</p>

  <p>Government surveillance, through Five-Eyes and PRISM, while being a useful tools to protect society from terrorism, and other external threats that the people of any nation lack the resources to defeat, is more like a trojan horse containing the very nightmares society is trying to get away from. According to M. Richards (2013) when the public know the government is surveilling them, they conform to conventional or mainstream political and social ideologies, so as to not 'step out of line'. While public knowledge of a surveillance system such as this encourages people to be on their best behaviour as we see from A. Mitchell and L. Diamond (2018) who reports on the surveillance state in China, this is utterly dystopian, as it inherently takes away public integrity - the freedom to do the right thing.</p>

  <p>Government surveillance also has a great impact on the individual. As we are told by Laura Silver, (2021), current ideological differences in the United States have already caused it to become extremely divided, and when government workers are politically attached to an ideology, using data surveillance on citizens, they can knowingly or unknowingly discriminate amongst different people based on ideology.</p>

  <p>We can mitigate risks such as these by creating laws that keep every government surveillance program transparent to the public, and make sure that the data collected is only only people that are under investigation - essentially force law enforcement to require a warrant to be able to request discovery of an individual's personal data.</p>
