  <h2 style="text-align: center;">The choices of Government Surveillance</h2>

  <p>Sometime in the near future, government surveillance could become a big problem. If we look at China, their social credit score is said in an article to be "a set of databases and initiatives that monitor and assess the trustworthiness of individuals, companies and government entities" (A. Lee, 2020). When listening to the reviews the fellow citizens gave they seemed very pleased with the system saying that it drove them to be better citizens. What you do not hear, is that disobeying these rules could result in them losing access to their bank accounts or even losing standard rights such as voting.
  </p>

  <p>On the flip side, government surveillance can be considered useful when applying this to other fields. However big changes need to occur, which needs to start with the relationship between the government and us as the public. Over these past few decades, the public have slowly begun to move away from being partners to the government but rather subject to them. The public are starting to have less say about topics that could potentially change the circumstances we live in. In Joe Rogan's podcast featuring Edward Snowden (one of the whistleblowers that exposed PRISM and Five-Eyes) he brought up a very important point saying "there is a clear overclassification problem within these corporations" (J. Rogan, 2019). In order for government surveillance to be able to operate in today's society this needs to change drastically and us as the public need to have a better idea of everything going on behind closed doors rather than being left in the dark.</p>
  
  <p>Government surveillance cannot be the only solution to problems we do not know of yet. Fear of the unknown is the main reason why the public turns to the government for help. If instead of changing the way the government surveilled the public we instead took away the fear nested in each individual, we would no longer need such extensive mass surveillance in the first place. </p>

  <p>On another podcast, Joe Rogan introduced a very powerful idea saying "So many people believe that twitter, instagram, Cnn, Fox news, wall street journal or New York times is an accurate metric of what's happening on the planet" (J. Rogan, 2019). There has been a lot of speculation surfacing over these past few years about how reliable these news sources are and the fact that they may not be uncovering the complete truth. It is very easy for mainstream sources of information to slowly integrate agendas into the public, that they  determine how we feel about the world, causing us to feel certain emotions. Government surveillance started to come to light when the horrific event of 9/11 occured. However in order for there to be minimal questions asked the public had to be on board with everything taking place but how could this be done. Well it's easy, simply push the idea through these so-called news sources that we need to be afraid of a similar event like this happening again and that a surveillance system being introduced would be the best way to resolve the problem. Before we know it the government has information about every single individual at their disposal and us as the public have been on board with it without us even realising.</p>
