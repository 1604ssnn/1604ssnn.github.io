<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>
<p>  Government surveillance brings about about many benefits to society. "It is an integrated system of hardware and software including devices for sensing, measuring, storing, processing, and exchanging information and intelligence about the environment.", Gandy (1989, p. 62)</p>
<p>  As said by Haggerty & Gazso(2005) "First, surveillance can provide information that can be used to understand the operation of terrorists. Second, surveillance can be used to deter another terrorist attack. Third, surveillance can be used to intervene in real time to prevent terrorist acts before they occur.". Having the ability to intercept messages between suspected terrorists allows for faster intervention from scurity forces.</p>
<p>  Government surveillance can also save lives during pandemics by keeping track of the movement of millions of people that may or may not be infected or carriers of viruses. For instance, New Zealand's covid tracer app has helped the government and the health department to keep track of areas of exposure of the virus and helped contain the further spread of the out break. This also helps in keeping people that were infected in isolation, preventing further outbreak, solidifying New Zealand as one of the first coutries in the world to become free of the covid-19 virus.</p>
<p>  Another good example of government surveilance is the reduction of crime rates in areas known to have CCTV cameras. This is based on a research by Kate Painter and Nick Tilley(1999) "Surveillance of Public Space: CCTV, Street Lighting and Crime Prevention", in which the study was based upon if the there was a difference in crime rates in areas with CCTV cameras and areas without CCTV cameras. They concluded there was a slight difference in crime rate where having CCTV cameras in a particular area helped put off criminals from commiting crimes. </p>
