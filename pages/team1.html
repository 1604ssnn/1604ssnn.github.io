<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>
<p>  Government surveillance, the digital system that is used to ensure the safety and security of the population. It is a tool that is vital and is widely used in the formation of any government body, as a tool to gather information on not just potential threats within a country, but also internationally. Coining the term "Knowledge is Power" by Sir Francis Bacon (1957), having this ability to gather information and being in the know is what keeps those in power with the knowledge and power to act upon said information or even plan for future development of said country. But how far has this tool of data harvesting been taken, and how far should it be taken before it becomes another weapon that is used against us? Who decides how far is too far and what can and cannot be used against an individual?</p>
<p>  Having a surveillance system in this day and age of modern technology is a must, as it is already integrated into how civil defense forces and police keep our society safe. There are obvious benefits to having surveillances available in most parts of a city or a country. For instance, people would feel safer knowing there are surveillance cameras in dark streets or around a gas station late at night, as it lets them know that they are being watched over and feel safer walking around town in the dark. Based on a study by Kate Painter and Nick Tilley, there has been shown a reduced number of crimes committed in areas that have surveillance cameras that are openly displayed then in areas that do not have any surveillance cameras at all. Knowing that an area is being monitored puts off criminals from acting on their plans to perform their criminal activity in said area. The same can be said on detecting and preventing terrorist attacks. Being able to gather information on almost every person, security agencies can detect and intercept messages and plans from terrorist organizations and crime rings like drug cartels, smugglers, and even human traffickers. This helps a lot in the process of putting together an operation to bring criminal groups to justice and prevent harm from reaching the populace.</p>
<p>  Government surveillance can also be said to have saved our country, New Zealand, from the further spread Covid-19 during the initial outbreak. Having the ability to detect and follow the whereabouts of people that have been infected or who were carriers of the virus, this helped health officers detect and contain areas and people that have been in contact with the carrier and prevent further spread. This played a huge part in reducing and getting rid of the virus from the New Zealand by the year 2021 and became one of the first countries to be clean of the virus.</p>
<p>  Although a lot of the benefits of Government surveillances can be found and stated, it also comes with a lot of negatives to many parties. For instance, having the power to spy on criminals also means that they have the power to spy on regular people too. Having the counter argument of "people should not be worried of being checked into or spied on if they have nothing bad or incriminating to hide" is flawed, even if you have not done anything wrong by definition of the law, the government gets to define what is wrong and what is not. They could do something wrong with your information and incriminate you. As said by professor Bill Buchanan(2019), "Privacy is an inherent human right, and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect. It is about choice, and having the power to control how you present yourself to the world.". No one knows how far government surveillance would be taken, how much information is need for a person to be classified as dangerous and a threat to others? Being ignorant of how your information is being harvested can be seen as dangerous and as you are allowing everything that can be known about you as a person could be used against you, and you would not have a way to defend yourself from these attacks. </p>
<p>  It would be great if there was an alternative to government surveillance in maintaining public and national security, but this digital system has already become fully integrated in how we public order is maintained. It is hard to imagine a world where the power of having information is not being used by the government to monitor and govern over the populace. But this has put us in a situation where we feel like we have someone watching us over our shoulders and living in that situation is not living like a human anymore but livestock. Giving people, whom we do not even know personally, the power to know who and what we are and do whatever they want with it should not be a thing, as serious consequences could be seen in the far future. A future in where people live in constant fear of doing something wrong, just like a flock of sheep.</p>
<p>  In conclusion, there are many benefits and negatives to the digital system of government surveillance, and we should be more aware of what is going on in our lives and how our personal information is being handled. We should also not let this be the only way we maintain public security and strive to find alternatives and improve.</p>
